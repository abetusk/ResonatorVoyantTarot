## Overview

![tarot reading screenshot](images/rvt_screenshot.png)

Resonator Voyant Tarot is an experiment in creating generative tarot cards.

Though steeped in spirituality, the reasons for doing a tarot reading need
not be mystical as it can be a source of creativity and help with
imaginative problem solving.

Each deck is created from a "vocabulary" of images with predefined rules
for joining them together.
Each card has a template with some fixed
elements and other random elements put together.

For example, a major arcana card of "The Fool" would have a fixed "fool"
image with randomly chosen elements coming out of the base. Another
 example is a minor arcana card that has the suite graphic (e.g.
"swords") positioned in a pattern appropriate for the numbered card
with a random "creature" created in the center.

Color palettes are also chosen randomly, with a consistent color
palette chosen for each suite. 

## Quick Start

[Live Demo](https://abetusk.github.io/ResonatorVoyantTarot/)

To run locally:

```
git clone https://github.com/abetusk/ResonatorVoyantTarot
cd ResonatorVoyantTarot
python3 -m http.server
```

```
firefox 'http://localhost:8000'
```

### Building

Building the main Javascript file, `browser-sibyl.js`, is pretty ad-hoc but
via:

```
cd scripts ; ./build.sh
```

This will create the `js/browser-sibyl.js` used as the engine to create the SVG
cards and has the data for SVG graphics and tarot reading.

## TODO

* Show card interpretations for the 'full deck' view
* Allow for suite elements to be rotated. Sword suites can have some 'texture' added to them with a little rotation.
* Allow for different suites other than the "default" four (swords, keys, pentacles, cups)
* Rotate cups (and maybe others) under Queen and King cards (or allow option to do so)
* Fix some of the color scheme where the background images appear indistinguishable from the background color
* Provide script to render SVG deck large enough for print
* Print a custom deck (one possibility is [makeplayingcards.com](https://www.makeplayingcards.com/promotional/personalized-tarot-cards.html))
